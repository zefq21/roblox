The first Roblox FPS unlocker for macOS. This script works  on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Setup

You will first need to download the script, you can use the following command in the Terminal to do it:
```
curl -sfLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanylow/rbxfpsunlocker-osx/script/install_fps_unlocker
```
And then run it using this command:
```
sh install_fps_unlocker 
```
After executing the script, you should see a confirmation that the unlocker was installed.

*Note: you must run the command again when Roblox updates.*

*Note: if you're using macOS Ventura or newer and your display doesn't support more than 60 Hz **you won't see the effect of this program** unless you use the Vulkan renderer. Please don't create issues asking about this.*
